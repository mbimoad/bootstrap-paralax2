<h1>👋 Hello!</H1>

📂 This is a GitHub repository that I created to showcase my ability in using Bootstrap and parallax effects in web design.

🌟 Inside this repository, you will find the code I created to make a modern and attractive website using Bootstrap, a popular front-end framework.

🚀 I also used parallax effects in some parts of the page to add depth and dynamism to the design.

🎨 To give a clearer picture of how the website looks like, I included cute and adorable illustrations and emoticons.

👨‍💻 I hope you enjoy exploring my code and get inspired to create more attractive and effective web designs using Bootstrap and parallax effects!
